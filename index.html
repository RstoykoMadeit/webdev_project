		  <h1>Roman Stoyko's Resume</h1>
		  <p>Hello, my name is Roman. I enjoy spending my time rotting and playing video games. Im a massive nerd even though i've spent considerable time and money to not look like one. This year I finished a full sleeve tattoo and I am planing on getting more. Star wars will always be the superior nerd fandom any other opinion is grounds for fighting. As most I enjoy music, typically rap and Rnb,I have been branching out to music from different countries. I took an intrest in IT because this field is always going to be the future.</p>
