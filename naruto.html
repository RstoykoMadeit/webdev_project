			<p>Naruto is an anime that follows the story of Naruto Uzamaki. He is a young sinobi or ninja of the hidden leaf village. When he was a baby his father sealed an anchient beast called the nine tailed fox inside of him. This battle with the nine tails orphaned Naruto and having the nine tails inside his body ostracized him. The village feared him, not because he was a bad kid but because of the monster sealed away in him. Naruto however didn't let this stop him from advancing and becoming one of the most powerful sinobi.</p>
